# COVID’19 and Mood of Spotify Users: an intricate interplay

### View Demo: https://asadahmadk.github.io/MSDVthesis/

Music has a profound impact on our lives, calming and comforting our souls. Last few years the world has undergone tremendous changes. This project is a short and simple introduction of the basic principles of mood as defined by Spotify using the data from Spotify open API. My project focuses on the intricate interplay of four major covid events and the mood of spotify users. The four components of music as identified by Spotify are: valence, energy, danceability and tempo. Using the major events of COVID’19 these four elements are analyzed in the visualization using digital medium for the users to explore  these elements against the timeline. 

This topic mainly addresses the interesting fact that when individuals are sad, depressed or unmotivated they tend to listen to positive, high energy and danceable music. It covers a social and psychological aspect of Spotify users, contributing to the curiosity of the user base and how to better understand human behavior. My method is to allow users to identify the casual relationship and the coping mechanisms of the Spotify users during tough times like COVID’19. It is one of its kind of works as it represents the interplay of mood during COVID’19 and music. While mostly the published works are curtailed to trends but do not overlap with a global event like a pandemic.
