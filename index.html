                The widespread outbreak of the coronavirus had a profound impact, overwhelming healthcare
                infrastructures,
                causing a sharp decline in stock markets, and necessitating strict limitations on individual
                mobility
                for
                countless individuals affecting their mood. In the last few years we have witnessed a significant
                transformation
                in the world but what made our lives better was
                music.

                Music is used across cultures and ages as a powerful mood regulator. The mood of music is one of
                main
                motivations why people devote so much time, energy, and money to it.

            <h1> What is the Composition of Mood?</h1>
            <p>
                Spotify defines the four components of mood on a scale of 0 to 1 in terms of: valence, energy,
                danceability
                and tempo. For this article, data of top 100 songs each month is used for these variables using
                Spotify
                API
                of from January 2019 to December 2022.
